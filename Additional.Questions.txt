Q. How well does your note-searching-api scale or not scale? How would you make your search more efficient?
A. Currently the API stores the data in a HashMap since it was the easiest to implement for the purpose.
   To scale it with more data, we could add a data store such as MongoDB whcih would be easier to setup and scale.

Q. How would you add security to your API?
A. One way of providing security on the Server side would be by injecting a JAX-RS SecurityContext using the @Context annotation.
   We can also secure specific resources with authorization either by specifying them in the web.xml or using security annotations.

   Client side security can be accomplished using the OAuth Authorization specification.

Q. What features should we add to this API next?
A. We could add additional features such as updating and deleting a note. Authentication as discussed in the previous
   question would also be a welcome addition. Also nice would be to include ways to handle errors gracefully than spit
   out compiler stack trace.

Q. How would you test the API?
A. Using the Jersey Test Framework. I have added some tests along with the implementation.
